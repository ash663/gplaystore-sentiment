Sentiment analysis of Google Playstore reviews

The application collects data from Google Playstore by making use of the API provided by http://playstoreapi.com (getdata.py)
Then, in polarity_classifier_m.py, the process of sentiment analysis takes place. The collected data is stored locally on the server.

UPDATE: http://playstoreapi.com seems to be shutdown
